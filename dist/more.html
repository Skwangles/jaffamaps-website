        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>
          Starting as a frustrated university student struggling to find his
          class room, CampusVirtual was born. Over the course of his last year
          at university, Alexander created this software to map out the
          University of Waikato, and soon saw a need for this software in places
          like confusing hospitals, airports, and other places where you can
          easily lose your way. Using state-of-the-art Computer Vision
          technology, CampusVirtual was able to create a virtual tour that was
          not only accurate but also easy to navigate.
        </p>

          Presenting his prototype at the University of Waikato's Engineering
          Design Show, Alexander was awarded the
